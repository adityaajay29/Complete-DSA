concept of dfs tree

there are 2 types of edges
forward edge and backedge
when a node is traversed from its parent, then that ede is a forward edge
if that node traverses back to its any ancestor, then it is a backedge
since that node is connected to both parent and ancestor, the backedge can nevr be the bridge
because in it will still have connection to its parent
but if backedge is not present, then that forward edge can be the bridge

we use 2 arrays to find store the intime of all the nodes and the nearest ancestor of all nodes
