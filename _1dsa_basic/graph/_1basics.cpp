// two types
// undirected and directed
// nodes are the vertices, linking is the edge
// two popular ways of representing, adjecency matrix, adjecency list 
// in adjecency matrix representation, we make v*v matrix, where v is number of nodes
// in adjecency list representaion, we create a list of array
// list can be either vector, ot linked list
// vector is a better option generally, as most operations are O(1), except in case
// when we have to double the size, in that case, copying will take O(n) time, and aux space
